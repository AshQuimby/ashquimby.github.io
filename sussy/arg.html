        I can't believe she stabbed me like that. It really hurt my feelings.
        I thought we had something, but a knife in the chest is not the thing I wanted from her.

        The goblins got in my head again ;p. I'm so silly! I don't know how I didn't notice them.
        I guess that's left up to the reader to find out!

        Can't believe I already forgot about this! I don't know how I'm that stupid :facepalm:. More importantly, It's Saint Patrick's day tomorrow.
        Time flies when It's the middle of summer.

        to leave me alone.
