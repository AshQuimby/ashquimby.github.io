    <h2>The real puzzle was the theme we found along the way</h2>
    <h3>Tattered Note</h3>
    <p>I'm not a fan of goodbyes, I guess I don't get the concept of “Bittersweet;” for me it's just bitter. I just don't like having to say goodbye to the people I care about. In a way I love and hate endings in general. Then ag- <i>[ It's torn off right here ]</i></p>

Two letters from shore, and just after my final of being an answer. Goodbye.</p>
